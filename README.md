# Advent of Code 2022

- Solutions are written in C++, (except for day 7 because I got mad maybe ill rewrite it in c++ later)
- C++ 17 to be exact
- Some depend on boost because im not writing a hash function for a pair
- The make files call clang++ directly
- The sample input is in sample.txt the real input is in input.txt
